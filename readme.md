# Microsoft Cheese Terminator

This is a recreation of the game _**Microsoft Cheese Terminator**_.

_**Microsoft Cheese Terminator**_ is a [Sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban "wikipedia:Sokoban") clone developed by Zsolt Krajcsik and published by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") in 1992 for [Windows 3.x](https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Windows_3.x "Windows 3.x"). It was offered as part of a promotion by Microsoft in Eastern Europe where users would receive a floppy disk containing the game after filling out and mailing a survey.

Taken from [The Microsoft Fandom](https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Microsoft_Cheese_Terminator "The Microsoft Fandom").
